\subsection{RingVRFs with SpecialG}
\label{subsec:rvrf_faster}

We can apply the results of the previous subsections to construct a ringVRF using $\SpecialG$ that allows a\eprint{n incredibly }{ }fast amortized ring VRF prover. \PedVRF has a sigma protocol which proves the relation $\reltwo'=\mathcal{R}_{eval}$ and we can then use SpecialG for a relation $\relone$ similar to $\Rring$.

For this, we need an appropriate choice of $\pk$ to commit to $\sk$. We use a Pedersen commitment using some Jubjub curve $\ecJ$. $\ecJ$ contains a large subgroup $\grJ$ of prime order $p_\grJ$. Typically $p_\grJ$ is smaller than $p$, the order of $\grE$, certainly when $\ecJ$ is an Edwards curve with a cofactor. Since $\sk \in \F_p$, we represent it with two $\F_{p_\grJ}$ elements $\sk_0,\sk_1 \leq 2^{\lambda}$ 
so that $\sk = \sk_0 + \sk_1 \, 2^{\lambda} \mod p$ for some fixed $(\log_2 p)/2  < \lambda < \log_2 p_\grJ$. $\rVRF.\KeyGen$ now samples $\sk\leftsample \F_{p}$, computes $\sk_1,\sk_2$, samples a blinding factor $d \leftsample \F_{p_\grJ}$ and then returns a blinded Pedersen commitment as the public key $\rVRF.\pk=\sk_0\, \genJ_0 + \sk_1\, \genJ_1 + d \genJ_2$ and the secret key $\rVRF.\sk = (\sk_0,\sk_1,d)$. Here $\genJ_0,\genJ_1,\genJ_2 \in \grJ$ are independent generators.

We thus have a fairly efficient instantiation for $\Lring^\inner$ give by

$$ \relone = \Setst{ (\comring, \sk ; \sk_0, \sk_1,\openring) }{
  \sk = \sk_0+ 2^{\lambda} \sk_1 \wedge
 \genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{ \eprint{\rVRF.}{}\OpenRing(\comring,\openring) }{ \,\, = \sk_0 \genJ_0 + \sk_1 \genJ_1 + d \genJ_2 }
} \mathperiod $$

In combination, $\SpecialG$ for $\relone$ and $\PedVRF$ give a NIZKs for the following relation, giving a RingVRF:

$$ \rel_{rvrf} = \Setst{ \Out, \msg, \comring ; \sk_0,\sk_1,\openring }{
    \eprint{
        \eprint{\rVRF.}{}\OpenRing(\comring,\openring)    \textrm{ and }
        \,\, = \sk_0 \genJ_0 + \sk_1 \genJ_1 + d \genJ_2, \quad
        \Out = \rVRF.\Eval(\sk_0+ 2^{\lambda} \sk_1,\msg)
    }{
        \begin{aligned}
        & \eprint{\rVRF.}{}\OpenRing(\comring,\openring) \\
        & \,\, = \sk_0 \genJ_0 + \sk_1 \genJ_1 + d \genJ_2,\\
        & \Out = \rVRF.\Eval(\sk_0+ 2^{\lambda} \sk_1,\msg)
        \end{aligned}
    }
} $$

\paragraph{Efficiency:} If we have a $\SpecialG$ proof for $\relone$ for our $\pk$ in a ring $\comring$, to generate a RingVRF proof for the same ring, we need to run $\SpecialG.\Reprove$ and $\PedVRF.\Sign$. $\PedVRF.\Sign$ requires two scalar multiplications on $\ecE_1$
 and two on the same or faster $\ecE'$,
so together with $\SpecialG.\Reprove$ costing four scalar multiplications
on $\ecE_1$ and two on $\ecE_2$, our amortized prover time
 runs faster than 12 scalar multiplications on typical $\ecE_1$ curves. 
We expect the three pairings dominate verifier time, but
 verifiers also need five scalar multiplications on $\ecE_1$.

Importantly, our fast ring VRF's amortized prover time now rivals
group signature schemes' performance \cite{group_sig_survey}.
We hope this ends the temptation to deploy group signature like
 constructions where the deanonymization vectors matter.

% TODO \PedVRF.\OpenKey(\compk,\openpk)

\def\longeq{=\mathrel{\mkern-10mu}=}% {=\joinrel=} % https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/35404/is-there-a-wider-equal-sign
We describe a much faster choice \pifast for \piring with
opaque inputs $x_1 \longeq \sk$ and transparent inputs $y_1 \longeq \comring$
 so that taking
 $\genG \longeq \chi_1$, $\genB \longeq \genB_\gamma$, and $\openpk \longeq b$
in \PedVRF yields an incredibly fast amortized ring VRF prover.
Also \PedVRF itself proves knowledge of $X' =  \sk\, \chi_1 + b \genB_\gamma $,
 as required by $\SpecialG.\Verify$.
% $$ X' + Y = \comring\, \Upsilon_1 + \sk\, \chi_1 + b \genB_\gamma $$

A priori, we do not know $\chi_1$ during the trusted setup for $\pifast$,
which prevents computing $\pk = \sk\, \chi_1$ inside $\pifast$.
Instead, we propose $\ring$ contain commitments to $\sk$ over
some Jubjub curve $\ecJ$, while $\sk \in \F_p$ remains a scale for $\grJ$.

We know the large subgroup $\grJ$ of $\ecJ$ typically has smaller prime
order $p_\grJ$ than $\grE$, itself due to $\ecJ$ being an Edwards curve.
%
We thus choose $\sk_0,\sk_1 < p_\grJ$ with at least $\lambda$ bits
so that
 $\PedVRF.\sk = \sk_0 + \sk_1 \, 2^{\lambda} \mod p_\grE$
becomes our secret key.
\footnote{If $\lambda \approx 128$ then $p, p_\grJ > 2^{2\lambda-3}$.}
Our $\rVRF.\KeyGen$ \eprint{returns}{shall now return}
a secret key of the form $\rVRF.\sk = (\sk_0,\sk_1,d)$
 with $d \leftsample \F_{p_\grJ}$ and
a public key of the form
 $\rVRF.\pk = \sk_0\, \genJ_0 + \sk_1\, \genJ_1 + d \genJ_2$,
for some independent $\genJ_0,\genJ_1,\genJ_2 \in \grJ$. % (see \S\ref{subsec:AML_KYC}).
\footnote{Interestingly we avoid range proofs for $\sk_1$ and $\sk_2$ by this independence.}
We thus have a fairly efficient instantiation for $\Lring^\inner$ give by

$$ \Lfast^\inner = \Setst{ \sk_0 + 2^{128} \sk_1, \comring }{
 \eprint{ \exists d,\openring \textrm{\ s.t.\ } }{}
 % 0 < \sk_0,\sk_1 < 2^{128} \textrm{\ and\ } 
 \genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{ \eprint{\rVRF.}{}\OpenRing(\comring,\openring) }{ \,\, = \sk_0 \genJ_0 + \sk_1 \genJ_1 + d \genJ_2 }
} \mathperiod $$

Applying our rerandomization \Reprove to $\pifast^\inner$ with opaque input
yields a zkSNARK $\pifast$ with the extra $\PedVRF.\OpenKey$ arithmetic to
have exactly the form $\piring$.

We explain later in \S\ref{sec:ring_hiding} how one could
choose $\chi_1$ independent before doing the trusted setup,
 and then wire $\chi_1$ into $\pifast$ inside $C$.
We could then prove $\pk = \sk\, \chi_1$ directly inside $\pifast^\inner$,
but doing so here requires slow non-native field arithmetic.

At this point, $\PedVRF.\Sign$ requires two scalar multiplications on $\ecE_1$
 and two on the somewhat faster $\ecE'$,
so together with rerandomization costing four scalar multiplications
on $\ecE_1$ and two on $\ecE_2$, our amortized prover time
 runs faster than 12 scalar multiplications on typical $\ecE_1$ curves. 
We expect the three pairings dominate verifier time, but
 verifiers also need five scalar multiplications on $\ecE_1$.

As an aside, one could construct a second faster curve with the same
group order as $\grE$, which speeds up two scalar multiplications
 in both the prover and verifier. 

Importantly, our fast ring VRF' amortized prover time now rivals
group signature schemes' performance \cite{group_sig_survey,}.
We hope this ends the temptation to deploy group signature like
 constructions where the deanonymization vectors matter.
