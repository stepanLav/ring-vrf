    abstract = "Due to the simplicity and performance of zk-SNARKs they are widely used in real-world cryptographic protocols, including blockchain and smart contract systems. Simulation Extractability (SE) is a necessary security property for a NIZK argument to achieve Universal Composability (UC), a common requirement for such protocols. Most of the works that investigate SE focus on its strong variant which implies proof non-malleability. In this work we investigate a relaxed weaker notion, that allows proof randomization, while guaranteeing statement non-malleability, which we argue to be a more natural security property. First, we show that it is already achievable by Groth16, arguably the most efficient and widely deployed SNARK nowadays. Second, we show that because of this, Groth16 can be efficiently transformed into a black-box weakly SE NIZK, which is sufficient for UC protocols.",

    abstract="In ASIACRYPT 2016, Bellare, Fuchsbauer and Scafuro studied security of non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments in the face of parameter subversion. They showed that achieving subversion soundness (soundness without trusting to the third party) and standard zero-knowledge is impossible at the same time. On the positive side, in the best case, they showed that one can achieve subversion zero-knowledge (zero-knowledge without trusting to the third party) and soundness at the same time. In this paper, we show that one can amplify their best positive result and construct NIZK arguments that can achieve subversion zero-knowledge and simulation (knowledge) soundness at the same time. Simulation (knowledge) soundness is a stronger notion in comparison with (knowledge) soundness, as it also guarantees non-malleability of proofs. Such stronger security guarantee is a must in practical systems. To prove the result, we show that given a NIZK argument that achieves Sub-ZK and (knowledge) soundness, one can use an OR-based construction to define a new language and build a NIZK argument that will guarantee Sub-ZK and simulation (knowledge) soundness at the same time. We instantiate the construction with the state-of-the-art zk-SNARK proposed by Groth [Eurocrypt 2016] and obtain an efficient SNARK that guarantees Sub-ZK and simulation knowledge soundness.",

      abstract="A Simulation Extractable (SE) zk-SNARK enables a prover to prove that she knows a witness for an instance in a way that the proof: (1) is succinct and can be verified very efficiently; (2) does not leak information about the witness; (3) is simulation-extractable -an adversary cannot come out with a new valid proof unless it knows a witness, even if it has already seen arbitrary number of simulated proofs. Non-malleable succinct proofs and very efficient verification make SE zk-SNARKs an elegant tool in various privacy-preserving applications such as cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and etc. In Eurocrypt 2016, Groth proposed the most efficient pairing-based zk-SNARK in the CRS model, but its proof is vulnerable to the malleability attacks. In this paper, we show that one can efficiently achieve simulation extractability in Groth's zk-SNARK by some changes in the underlying language using an OR construction. Analysis and implementations show that in practical cases overload has minimal effects on the efficiency of original scheme which currently is the most efficient zk-SNARK. In new construction, proof size is extended with one element from {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}G{\}}{\}}{\_}1{\$}{\$}, one element from {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}G{\}}{\}}{\_}2{\$}{\$}, plus a bit string that totally is less than 256 bytes for 128-bit security. Its verification is dominated with 4 pairings which is the most efficient verification among current SE zk-SNARKs.",

      abstract="Among various NIZK arguments, zk-SNARKs are the most efficient constructions in terms of proof size and verification which are two critical criteria for large scale applications. Currently, Groth's construction, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf {\{}Groth16{\}}{\$}{\$}Groth16, from Eurocrypt'16 is the most efficient and widely deployed one. However, it is proven to achieve only knowledge soundness, which does not prevent attacks from the adversaries who have seen simulated proofs. There has been considerable progress in modifying {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf {\{}Groth16{\}}{\$}{\$}Groth16to achieve simulation extractability to guarantee the non-malleability of proofs. We revise the Simulation Extractable (SE) version of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf {\{}Groth16{\}}{\$}{\$}Groth16proposed by Bowe and Gabizon that has the most efficient prover and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}crs{\}}{\$}{\$}crssize among the candidates, although it adds Random Oracle (RO) to the original construction. We present a new version which requires 4 parings in the verification, instead of 5. We also get rid of the RO at the cost of a collision resistant hash function and a single new element in the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}crs{\}}{\$}{\$}crs. Our construction is proven in the generic group model and seems to result in the most efficient SE variant of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf {\{}Groth16{\}}{\$}{\$}Groth16in most dimensions.",
