\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we defined a new cryptographic primitive ring VRF in the UC model. It is a ring signature which also lets generate a random number with respect to their keys and the signed message. We also defined a new technique called zero-knowledge continuation. It helps to regenerate a zero-knowledge proof for the same statement and witness without running the prove algorithm after it is run once. We constructed $ \SpecialG $ based on Groth16 \cite{Groth16} and showed that it is a zero-knowledge continuation. Our UC-secure ring VRF construction can deploy $ \SpecialG $ to efficiently instantiate the signing process.
