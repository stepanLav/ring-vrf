% \section{Introduction}

We answer three questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
What are the cheapest SNARK proofs?  \quad
Ones users reuse without reproving.
\item
How can identity be safe for online use?  \quad
By revealing nothing except users' uniqueness.
\item
How can ration card issuance be trusted?  \quad
By asking users trust a public list, not certificates.
\end{enumerate}

% First

Rerandomizable zkSNARKs like Groth16 \cite{Groth16} admit a
transformation of a valid proof into another valid but unlinkable
proof of the exact same statement.  In practice, rerandomization
was never deployed because the public inputs link the usages.

We demonstrate in \S\ref{sec:rvrf_cont} a simple transformation of
any Groth16 zkSNARK into a {\it zero-knowledge continuation} whose
public inputs become opaque Pedersen commitments, with cheaply
rerandomizable blinding factors and proof.
These zero-knowledge continuations then prove validity of the contents
of Pedersen commitments, but can now be reused arbitrarily many times,
without linking the usages. 

As recursive SNARKs shall remain extremely slow,
we expect zero-knowledge continuations via rerandomization become
essential for zkSNARKs used outside the crypto-currency space.

\smallskip 

A {\it ring verifiable random function} (ring VRF) is a ring signature
that proves correct evaluation of some pseudo-random function (PRF)
determined by the actual key pair used in signing (see \S\ref{sec:rvrf_def}).
We build extremely efficient and flexible ring VRFs by amortizing a
zero-knowledge continuation that unlinkably proves ring membership
of a secret key, and then cheaply proving individual VRF evaluations.

As the PRF output is uniquely determined by the signed message and
signers actual secret key, we can therefore trivially link signatures
by the same signer that sign identical messages.
In effect, ring VRFs restrict anonymity similarly to but less than
 linkable ring signatures do, which makes them multi-use and contextual.

Anonymous credentials aka anonymized signatures come in myriad flavors,
many of which exist to limits the anonymity provided, ala
 attribute based credentials and group signatures. % \cite{group_sig_survey}.
%
Ring VRFs by weakening anonymity only contextually provide a safer,
more private, more flexible, more powerful, and more ethical
choice for all everyday anonymous credential use cases:  % needs:  ???

% Second

\paragraph{Identity:}

As an identity system, ring VRFs evaluated on a specific context or
domain name output a unique identity for the user at that domain or
context (see \S\ref{sec:app_identity}), which thereby prevents
Sybil behavior and permits banning specific users.
Yet users' activities remain unlinkable across distinct contexts or
domains, which supports diverse ethical identity usages.

We contrast this ethically straightforward ring VRF based identity
with the ethically problematic case of attribute based credential
schemes like IRMA \cite{IRMA_credentials},
 which are now marketed as an online privacy solution.
IRMA could improve privacy in narrow situations of course, but
overall attribute based credentials should {\it never} be considered
fit for general purpose usage, like the prevention of Sybil behavior.
Aside from general purpose identity, our existing offline verification
processes often better protect user privacy and human rights than
adopting online processes like IRMA.

In particular, there are many proposals by the W3C for attribute based
credential usage in \cite{w3c_vc_use_cases}, but broadly speaking they
all bring matching harmful uses.  % https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/
As an example, if users could easily prove their employment online when
applying for a bank account, then job application sites could similarly
demand proof of current employment, a clear injustice.

In general, abuse risks dictate that IRMA verifiers should be tightly
controlled by legislation, which becomes difficult internationally. 
%
Ring VRFs avoid these abuse risks by being truly unlinkable, and thus
yield anonymous credentials which safely avoid legal restrictions.

{\it Any ethical general purpose identity system should be based
upon ring VRFs, not attribute based credentials like IRMA.}

We credit Bryan Ford's work on proof-of-personhood parties \cite{pop2008,pop2017}
% https://bford.info/pub/dec/pop-abs/  https://bford.info/pub/net/sybil-abs/
with first espousing the idea that anonymous credentials should produce
contextual unique identifiers, without leaking other user attributes.

As a rule, there exist simple VRF variants for all anonymous credentials
like IRMA \cite{IRMA_credentials} or group signatures \cite{group_sig_survey}.
We focus exclusively upon ring VRFs for brevity, and because ring VRFs
contextual linkability alone covers more important use cases.

\paragraph{Rationing:}

Ring VRFs yield rate limiting or rationing systems, which work
similarly to identity applications, except the VRF input should also
include a approximate date and a bounded bound, and
 then their outputs should be tracked as nullifiers.
Yet, these nullifiers need only temporarily storage, which improves 
efficiency over anonymous money schemes like ZCash and blind signed tokens.

We must expect a degree of fraud whenever deploying purely certificate
based systems, as witnessed by the litany of fraudulent TLS and covid
certificates.  Ring VRFs avoid fraudulent certificates concerns because
they permit direct public audits of ring membership.

We know governments have ultimately little choice but to institute
rationing in response to shortages caused by climate change, ecosystem
collapse, and peak oil.  Ring VRFs could then help avoid ration card
fraud and thus reduce social unrest, while also protecting essential privacy.

Ring VRFs need heavier verifiers than single-use token credentials
based on OPRFs \cite{PrivacyPass} or blind signatures.
Yet, ring VRFs avoid the schemes separate issuance phase entirely,
which reduces complexity, simplifies scaling, and increases flexibility.

In particular, if governments issue ration cards based upon ring VRFs
then these credentials could safely support free tiers in online services
and games, and other limited advertiser promotions, as well as identity
applications like simple logins and prevention of spam and online abuse.

In this, we need authenticated domain separation of products or identity
consumers in queries to users' ring VRF credentials.  We briefly discuss
some sensible patterns in \S\ref{???} below, but overall authenticated
domain separation resemble TLS certificates except simpler in that
roots of trust can self authenticate if root keys act as domain separators.

We first in \S\ref{sec:rvrf_glue} unify a simple fast VRF signature given by a DLEQ proof together with a SNARK that proves ring membership by the public key, but here both must handle the public key as a Jubjub Pedersen commitment.  ZCash sapling uses a similar Schnorr signature scheme, without the Jubjub Pedersen commitment (TODO). 

We next in \S\ref{sec:rvrf_cont} split this SNARK into a slower preliminary proof extracting the public key from the ring, and a continuations by a second faster SNARK that prepares the Jubjub Pedersen commitment.  We prefer this version whenever rings have low churn, but our first version has faster verifier time by one miller loop, making it preferable for very high churn rings.

Also, zero-knowlede continuations wind up so much faster than bruit force techniques like recursion.

We focus exclusively upon ring VRFs because anonymous credentials come in myriad flavors.
In particular, there are group VRFs analogous to group signatures
\cite{group_sig_survey}, some fairly efficient.
%
We distrust group signatures however because typically some group master
has deanonymization capabilities, giving them only narrow real world uses,
like mailbox spam defense in Pond \cite{pond}.
%
In this vein, attribute based credentials are frequently instantiated
like group signatures, and thus similarly permit deanonymization by some
group master, which makes them similarly unsuitable for general purpose
privacy.
%
There exist exceptions like credentials using Brands \cite{brands06}, and
group signatures with Byzantine anonymity \cite{cryptoeprint:2021:181}.




like VRFs do,
but without identifying the signer beyond revealing this specific PRF output.


Ring VRFs avoid deanonymization by a group master, and impose coherent
structure upon authorization conditions, with all signers' keys
predating the authorization condition commitment \comring. 
% TODO: Relax in \S\ref{subsec:..}
%
Ring VRF outputs clearly link any two ring VRF signatures with
the same signer and input \msg, so in particular
ring VRFs with a singleton input domain are linkable ring signatures.
