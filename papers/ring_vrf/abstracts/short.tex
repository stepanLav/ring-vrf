Ring VRF is a ring signature that proves correct evaluation
of some authorized signer's PRF, while hiding the specific signer's
identity within some set of possible signers, known as the ring. We design a ring VRF protocol which has efficient instantiations with our novel {\em zero-knowledge continuation} technique.
% \eprint{We propose ring VRFs as a natural fulcrum around which a diverse array of zkSNARK circuits turn, making them an ideal target for optimization and eventually standards.}{}
We demonstrate a reusable {\em zero-knowledge continuation} technique,
which works by adjusting a Groth16 trusted setup to hide public inputs
when rerandomizing the Groth16.  We then build ring VRFs that amortizes
expensive ring membership proofs across many ring VRF signatures.
%
Our ring VRF needs only eight $\mathcal{G}_1$ and two
$\mathcal{G}_2$ scalar multiplications, making it the only ring signature
with performance competitive with group signatures.

Ring VRFs produce a unique identity for any given context but remain
unlinkable between different contexts.  These unlinkable but unique
pseudonyms provide a far better balance between user privacy and service
provider or social interests than attribute based credentials like IRMA credentials.
Ring VRFs also support anonymously rationing or rate limiting resource
consumption that winds up vastly more flexible and efficient than
purchases via money-like protocols.

We define the security of ring VRFs in the universally composable (UC) model and show that our protocol is UC secure.
