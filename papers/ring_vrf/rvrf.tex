\section{Ring VRFs}
\label{sec:rvrf}

Ring VRFs are firstly ring signatures broadly interpreted, in that they
prove an associated public key lies inside some commitment \comring to
the plausible signer set,
which anyone could construct from this set of public keys.
At the same time, ring VRFs prove correct output of a PRF keyed by
the signer's actual secret key, and evaluated on a supplied message \msg,
which then links ring VRF signatures sharing the same \msg.
