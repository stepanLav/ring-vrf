abstract = {Online anonymity often appears to undermine accountability, offering little incentive for civil behavior, but accountability failures usually result not from anonymity itself but from the disposability of virtual identities. A user banned for misbehavior---e.g., spamming from a free E-mail account or stuffing an online ballot box---can simply open other accounts or connect from other IP addresses. Instead of curtailing freedom of expression by giving up anonymity, online services and communities should support accountable pseudonyms: virtual personas that can provide both anonymity and accountability. We propose Pseudonym parties, a scheme for creating accountable pseudonyms, which combine inperson social occasions (parties) with technical infrastructure (a pseudonymous sign-on service) to enforce the rule that one real person gets one virtual persona on any participating online service. Pseudonym parties enable the user to adopt different personas in different online spaces without revealing the connection between them, while ensuring that each user has only one accountable pseudonym in each space. Pseudonym parties can be started incrementally in a fully decentralized fashion, can run on volunteer labor with minimal funds, and may even be fun.},

  abstract = {Individuals are increasingly confronted with requests to identify themselves
        when accessing services provided by government organizations, companies, and
        other service providers. At the same time, traditional transaction mechanisms are
        increasingly being replaced by electronic mechanisms that underneath their hood
        automatically capture and record globally unique identifiers. Taken together,
        these interrelated trends are currently eroding the privacy and security of
        individuals in a manner unimaginable just a few decades ago. Privacy activists
        are facing an increasingly hopeless battle against new privacy-invasive
        identification initiatives: the cost of computerized identification systems is
        rapidly going down, their accuracy and efficiency is improving all the time, much
        of the required data communication infrastructure is now in place, forgery of
        non-electronic user credentials is getting easier all the time, and data sharing
        imperatives have gone up dramatically. This paper argues that the privacy vs.
        identification debate should be moved into less polarized territory. Contrary to
        popular misbelief, identification and privacy are not opposite interests that
        need to be balanced: the same technological advances that threaten to annihilate
        privacy can be exploited to save privacy in an electronic age. The aim of this
        paper is to clarify that premise on the basis of a careful analysis of the
        concept of user identification itself. Following an examination of user
        identifiers and its purposes, I classify identification technologies in a manner
        that enables their privacy and security implications to be clearly articulated
        and contrasted. I also include an overview of a modern privacy-preserving
        approach to user identification},
