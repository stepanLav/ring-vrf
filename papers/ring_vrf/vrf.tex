\section{Verifiable Random Functions}
\label{sec:vrf}

Intuitively, a verifiable random function (VRF) welds a pseudo-random function into a signature scheme.
% \cite{vrfmicali,vrflysyanskaya,vrfshort}
% As in \cite[\S3.2 $\fvrf$]{praos}, we need a definition that both is simulation-based and provides pseudo-randomness under malicious key generation.  In other words, we demand an unpredictability property reminiscent of a random oracle even against adversaries who generate their secret and pubic key pair themselves.
%
VRFs have signature-like unforgeability properties, a fact which follows easily from most definitions. 
We follow \cite{agg_dkg} in making this explicit, while also
 exposing the auxiliary data supported by our constructions.
