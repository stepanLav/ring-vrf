TODO: Compltely rewrite shorter applications section


%TODO We can improve the following paragraph
In this paper,  we defined a new cryptographic primitive ring VRF in the UC model. It is a ring signature which also lets generate a random number with respect to their keys and the signed message. We  also defined a new technique called zero-knowledge continuation. It helps to regenerate a zero-knowledge proof for the same statement and witness without running the prove algorithm after it is run once. We constructed  $ \SpecialG $ based on Groth16 \cite{Groth16} and showed that it is a zero-knowledge continuation. Our UC-secure ring VRF construction can deploy $ \SpecialG $ to efficiently instantiate the signing process. 
We conclude our paper by giving some specific applications that shows the usability of a ring VRF.

%\paragraph{Identity:} 
%TODO For Jeff, I added some stuff from the Identity section, but we can add more from that section if they are formal and consistent with our construction.
%
% Ring VRFs yield anonymous identity systems:
%After a user and service establish a secure channel and
%the server authenticates itself with certificates, then
%the user authenticates themselves by providing an anonymous
%VRF signature with input \msg being the service's identity,
%thus creating an pseudonymous identified session with
%a pseudonym unlinkable from other contexts. We informally foresee a system that identifies a user anonymously with our ring VRF construction as follows:
%
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item {\em Register} --
%	Adds Pedersen commitments of the secret keys of the users into some \ring,
%	after verifying the user does not currently exist in \ring.
%	\item {\em Update} --
%	User agents regenerate their stored  \pifast every time \ring changes since $ \rel_{ring} $ changes,
%	likely receiving \comring and \openring from some ring management service.  
%	\item {\em Identify} --
%	Our user agent first opens a standard TLS connection to a server \msg,
%	both checking the server's name is \msg and checking certificate
%	transparency logs, and then computes the shared session id \aux.
%	Our user agent computes the user's identity
%	$\mathtt{id} = \rVRF.\Eval(\sk,\msg)$ on the server \msg,
%	% Our user agent next rerandomizes \pifast, \compk, and \openpk, computes
%	%  $\sigma = \PedVRF.\Sign(\sk,\openpk,\msg,\aux \doubleplus \compk \doubleplus \pifast)$
%	and finally sends the server their ring VRF signature
%	$\sigma \leftarrow \rVRF.\rSign(\sk,\openring,\msg,\aux)$. % $ = (\compk,\pifast,\sigma)$.
%	\item {\em Verify} -- 
%	After receiving $\sigma$ in channel \aux,
%	the server named \msg runs $ \rVRF.\Verify(\comring,\msg,\aux, \pifast,\sigma) $ and obtains $ \mathtt{id} $ if it verifies. In this way, the server makes sure that the user wit $ \mathtt{id} $ connects to it.
