\section{Ring hiding}% {Hiding rings} % ring membership circuits}
\label{sec:ring_hiding}

At first, one imagines sites would accept few rings because each ring
gives some users multiple ``Sybil'' identities within the site.
In practice however, we think many sites benefit from accepting
multiple overlapping rings for convenience and/or reach, but then
tolerate the resulting few ``Sybil'' users.

As sites accept more rings, we increase risks that each user's ring
\ctx reveals private user attributes, especially if
 users join many rings, sites accept many rings, and
 user agents manage the association poorly.
As a solution, we suggest tweaking \pifast to prove the ring itself
lies in some permitted set of rings, but hide the specific ring used.

We could achieve this using recursion inside \pifast of course,
but doing so lies out of scope.  We instead discuss using other
zero-knowledge continuation techniques or similar.


\subsection{Unique circuit}

As a first step, if all rings use the same circuit, then we hide the
ring among several rings using a second zero-knowledge continuation.
As this closely resembles \S\ref{subsec:rvrf_side_channel}, we prefer
a blind opening of a polynomial commitment \cite{KZG} to \comring choices,
accomplished with Caulk+ \cite{caulk+} or Caulk \cite{caulk} or similar.

As a special case, if users cannot change their keys too quickly, then
one could reduce the frequency with which users reprove their original
zero-knowledge by using multiple \comring choices across the history
of the same evolving ring database.

In this, we initially reserve space in for future \comring by padding
the polynomial commitment with say the base point, and then later
append new \comring using \cite{aSVC}.


\subsection{Multi-circuit}

We handle \comring in the multi-circuit case somewhat like the
unique circuit case.  We caution however that circuits should domain
separate their enforce \comring suitably.

\smallskip

A priori, \pifast chooses $\genG = \Chi_1$, which reveals the circuit,
due to its dependence upon the SRS like
$$ \Chi_1 = \left[ {\beta u_1(\tau) + \alpha v_1(\tau) + w_1(\tau) \over \gamma} \right]_1 \mathperiod $$

Instead, we propose to stabilize the public input SRS elements across circuits:
We choose $\Chi_{1,\gamma}$ independent before selecting the circuit
or running its trusted setup.
We then merely add an SRS element $\Chi_{1,\delta}$, for usage in $C$, that binds
our independent $\Chi_{1,\gamma}$ to the desired definition, so
$$ \Chi_{1,\delta} := \left[ {\beta u_1(\tau) + \alpha v_1(\tau) + w_1(\tau) - \gamma \Chi_{1,\gamma} \over \delta} \right]_1 \mathperiod $$
At this point, we replace $\Chi_1$ by $\Chi_{1,\gamma}$ everywhere and
include $\comring \, \Chi_{1,\delta}$ inside $C$.

In this way, all ring membership circuits could share identical
public input SRS points $\Chi_{1,\gamma}$, and similarly $\Chi_0$ if desired.

\smallskip

In their trusted setups, all Groth16 circuits wind up with unique
toxic waste $\alpha,\beta,\delta$ and hence unique SRS elements
$[\alpha]_1 \in \ecE_1$ and $[\beta]_2, [\delta]_2, [\gamma]_2 \in \grE_2$,
and a unique $\grE_T$ element $e([\alpha]_1, [\beta]_2)$.
We hence encounter the open questions:
How should we optimize blinding the verifier key elements derived from toxic waste?
In particular, could we choose some toxic waste elements identically across multiple trusted setups?

We could fix $\gamma=1$ across circuits for example. but in general
this question depends upon other factors, especially if the trusted setups
run concurrently.
If for example, $\alpha$ and/or $\beta$ could be identical across
concurrent trusted setups, then we avoid extensive complexity in
 handling $([\alpha]_1, [\beta]_2) \in grE_T$ terms.

We expect the $[\delta]_2$ might differ between different circuits.
As a nice solution, our Groth16 trusted setup could construct a
KZG polynomial commitment $\rho$ along with openings to the
various $\delta$ as $[\delta]_2$.  At this point, our signer could
blind open $\rho$ to the curve point $[\delta]_2$.
We think concurrent trusted setups could skip much complexity of
Caulk+ \cite{caulk+} or Caulk \cite{caulk} because actually the
 trusted setup erases all knowledge of all openings of $\rho$.
